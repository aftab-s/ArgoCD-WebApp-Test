    # Specify which namespace the config files in the repo should be applied to

  # Since by default there is no myapp namespace setup prior,
  # We have to make argo cd create a namespace "myapp" automatically while deploying the K8s cluster.

      automated: # this attribute will pull changes from (polls) git repo every 3 minute intervals
      # If that delay has to be removed, you can configure a Git Webhook
        selfHeal: true # Since by default, changes made to the live cluster manually will not trigger automated sync
        prune: true # If service.yaml is deleted in the git repo, the service must be deleted from the whole cluster also
